= Sandbox for understanding the POSIX job control mechanism

This repository is a playground for exploring POSIX job control mechanisms inside a very limited initial ramdisk environment.
It hosts primarily a `Makefile` and an `src/init.sh` script.
The `Makefile` will build an entire Linux system consisting of a kernel and an initial ramdisk based on `busybox`.
